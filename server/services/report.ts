// Clinical report generation via Sarvam AI (chat).
//
// Produces the SAME structured ReportData JSON (identical schema → identical
// report format/sections in the UI). Extracts ONLY what is present in the
// transcript — it never invents medicines, diagnoses, tests, dosages or advice —
// and ALWAYS outputs English regardless of the transcript language.
//
// Sarvam's chat model is a reasoning model with a hard per-request token cap
// (4096) shared between the reasoning trace and the answer. A rich consultation's
// full report JSON plus that reasoning easily exceeds the cap, which returned
// empty content ("token budget exhausted"). This module avoids that by:
//   1. Pre-translating a non-English transcript to English first.
//   2. Condensing a very long transcript into concise English facts (chunked).
//   3. Generating the report in SMALL SECTION GROUPS (not one giant JSON), each
//      well within the token budget, then merging them.
//   4. NOT using response_format:json_object — that option massively inflates the
//      reasoning trace; a "/no_think" hint plus prompt-level JSON works far better.
//   5. Retrying a group once if it comes back empty, and degrading a stubborn
//      group to empty rather than failing the whole report.
//
// The API key is read from the environment (SARVAM_API_KEY) and NEVER logged.
